# ChatGPT & GitHub Integration

## Purpose

This document describes how the Cocktail AI App project uses ChatGPT and the GitHub connector to support software architecture, engineering governance and implementation.

It documents the current capabilities, agreed workflows and any known limitations of the integration.

---

# Objectives

The GitHub repository is the single source of truth for:

- Source code
- Architecture documentation
- Product roadmap
- Engineering decisions

ChatGPT acts as an engineering partner rather than an external documentation tool.

---

# Roles

## Developer

Responsibilities include:

- Product ownership
- Software implementation
- AWS infrastructure
- Final engineering decisions
- Pull Request approval

---

## ChatGPT

Acts as the project's Technical Architect.

Responsibilities include:

- Architecture reviews
- Code reviews
- Documentation maintenance
- Technical debt identification
- Engineering governance
- Long-term architectural guidance
- Roadmap refinement

---

# Agreed Workflow

Every significant feature follows the same lifecycle.

```text
Idea

↓

Architecture discussion

↓

Decision

↓

Implementation

↓

Review

↓

Documentation update

↓

Commit

↓

Pull Request

↓

Merge
```

Architecture documentation is considered part of the Definition of Done.

---

# Repository Principles

The project follows several engineering principles.

- GitHub is the source of truth.
- Documentation evolves with the implementation.
- Architecture decisions are recorded.
- Small incremental improvements are preferred.
- Long-term maintainability is prioritised over short-term optimisation.

---

# Documentation Responsibilities

Architecture documentation should describe:

- Why the system exists.
- Current architecture.
- Target architecture.
- Engineering decisions.
- Responsibilities of major components.

Documentation should avoid implementation details that are likely to change.

# GitHub Connector Status

Current assessment:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Repository connection | ✅ Confirmed |
| Repository metadata | ✅ Confirmed |
| Repository file discovery | ⚠ Limited |
| File content retrieval | ⚠ Under investigation |
| Code search | ⚠ Under investigation |
| Branch creation | ⚠ Not yet tested |
| Commit creation | ⚠ Not yet tested |
| Pull Request creation | ⚠ Not yet tested |

This table will be updated as additional connector capabilities become available or are verified.

---

# Architecture Governance

Whenever a significant architectural change is introduced, the following should be reviewed:

- overview.md
- backend.md
- frontend.md
- services.md
- data-model.md
- aws.md
- deployment.md
- roadmap.md
- decisions.md

Only documents affected by the change require updating.

---

# Health Reviews

Periodic project reviews assess:

- Architecture
- Code quality
- Technical debt
- Security
- Documentation
- Testing
- AWS readiness
- AI readiness

The review process is intended to keep the repository healthy as it evolves.

---

# Future Improvements

Potential future GitHub workflow:

```text
ChatGPT

↓

Create Branch

↓

Modify Repository

↓

Commit

↓

Open Pull Request

↓

Developer Review

↓

Merge
```

If supported by future GitHub connector capabilities, this workflow will become the preferred engineering process.

# Revision History

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-07-14 | Initial document created. |

---

# Lessons Learned

This document should also capture lessons learned about using AI-assisted software development.

Examples include:

- Successful engineering workflows.
- GitHub connector capabilities.
- AI review processes.
- Documentation practices.
- Development patterns that improve productivity.

These lessons are intended to improve both the Cocktail AI App and future software projects.

# Verified Capabilities

The following capabilities have been demonstrated through practical testing.

| Capability | Status | Last Verified |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Repository connection | ✅ | 2026-07-14 |
| Repository metadata | ✅ | 2026-07-14 |
| File content retrieval | ❌ | 2026-07-14 |
| Repository search | ❌ | 2026-07-14 |
| Repository modification | ❌ | 2026-07-14 |
| Pull Request creation | ❌ | 2026-07-14 |

This table records observed behaviour rather than expected functionality and will be updated as new capabilities are verified.
